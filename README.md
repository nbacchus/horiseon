Description: For this challenge, I updated the starter code and removed the <div> soup and retagged the html code with better practice syntax throughout. In addition, I updated the CSS code to remove redundant descriptors and consolidate for best practices. I also added notes in the html and css for others to be able to clearly follow along.
